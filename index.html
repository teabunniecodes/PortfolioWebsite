                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <i>Here I will tell you all a little about myself as well as showcase some of the games and apps that I have programmed.</i>
                <p>I coached figure skating for many years, this was after a lifetime of being a competitive figure skater, both on national and international levels.  I became attached to my students and coworkers (whom I grew up with as I was training) even having many of them at my wedding, when I moved I couldn't imagine starting building my coaching career from the ground all over again (for the 3rd time).</p>
                <p>I found what I thought would be an amazing job and opportunity for growth, but after an incredibly unstable work situation and toxic environment my mental health begain to deteriorate further and further to the point I questioned my existence every day.  Taking some time off allowed me to work on coping mechanisms for my depression and anxiety.  I decided that I wanted to find something as fulfilling as I had found coaching and started to learn to code March of 2022.</p>
                <p>I absolutely fell in love with building things, figuring out how to make something work,just the entire thought process and logic behind how a program actually worked.  It was absolutey addicting and magical.  I wanted to learn how everything worked.  I taught myself python and built many games in the terminal and now through building this website I hope to learn html/css and Javascript.</p>

        <h2>Plan of action</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Build out what I want my main page to say - use this to learn/be comfortable with HTML</li>
                <li>Use CSS to design the main page - use this to learn/be comfortable with CSS</li>
                <li>Create a log in page/database so people need to sign in to play the games to keep score</li>
                <li>Build a second page for my "Mad Libs" game using HTML and CSS for UI</li>
                <li>Start to learn how to connect JS to the UI for front end web dev</li>
                <li>Connect to the python back end logic to have the game fully functional</li>
                <li>Create a database of the Mad Lib entries so it posts on another page - also design out</li>
                <li>Upload to heroku (probably not anymore as they will no longer be free) or if I am feeling <em>CONFIDENT</em> build my server with my raspberry pi4 to host and make live</li>
            </ol>
