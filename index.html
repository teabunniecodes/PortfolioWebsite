        <h3>Plan of action</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Build out what I want my main page to say - use this to learn/be comfortable with HTML</li>
                <li>Use CSS to design the main page - use this to learn/be comfortable with CSS</li>
                <li>Create a log in page/database so people need to sign in to play the games to keep score</li>
                <li>Build a second page for my "Mad Libs" game using HTML and CSS for UI</li>
                <li>Start to learn how to connect JS to the UI for front end web dev</li>
                <li>Connect to the python back end logic to have the game fully functional</li>
                <li>Create a database of the Mad Lib entries so it posts on another page - also design out</li>
                <li>Upload to heroku or if I am feeling <em>CONFIDENT</em> build my server with my raspberry pi4 to host and make live</li>
            </ol>
