TODO - Wordle
needs to check the guess with dictionary and wordle list to see if valid guess - if not then game yells at you
need to move onto the next guess line when pressing enter
need to color the letters for the guess
need to change the "yell message" so it doesnt show every letter as they are guessed (redundant)

you may want to look into the fetch documentation, you might be hitting some race conditions
